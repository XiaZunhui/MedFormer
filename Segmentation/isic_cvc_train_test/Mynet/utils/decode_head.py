class BaseDecodeHead(BaseModule, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base class for BaseDecodeHead.

    1. The ``init_weights`` method is used to initialize decode_head's
    model parameters. After segmentor initialization, ``init_weights``
    is triggered when ``segmentor.init_weights()`` is called externally.

    2. The ``loss`` method is used to calculate the loss of decode_head,
    which includes two steps: (1) the decode_head model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``loss_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to calculate the loss.

    .. code:: text

    loss(): forward() -> loss_by_feat()

    3. The ``predict`` method is used to predict segmentation results,
    which includes two steps: (1) the decode_head model performs forward
    propagation to obtain the feature maps (2) The ``predict_by_feat`` method
    is called based on the feature maps to predict segmentation results
    including post-processing.

    predict(): forward() -> predict_by_feat()

    Args:
        in_channels (int|Sequence[int]): Input channels.
        channels (int): Channels after modules, before conv_seg.
        num_classes (int): Number of classes.
        out_channels (int): Output channels of conv_seg.
        threshold (float): Threshold for binary segmentation in the case of
            `num_classes==1`. Default: None.
        dropout_ratio (float): Ratio of dropout layer. Default: 0.1.
        conv_cfg (dict|None): Config of conv layers. Default: None.
        norm_cfg (dict|None): Config of norm layers. Default: None.
        act_cfg (dict): Config of activation layers.
            Default: dict(type='ReLU')
        in_index (int|Sequence[int]): Input feature index. Default: -1
        input_transform (str|None): Transformation type of input features.
            Options: 'resize_concat', 'multiple_select', None.
            'resize_concat': Multiple feature maps will be resize to the
                same size as first one and than concat together.
                Usually used in FCN head of HRNet.
            'multiple_select': Multiple feature maps will be bundle into
                a list and passed into decode head.
            None: Only one select feature map is allowed.
            Default: None.
        loss_decode (dict | Sequence[dict]): Config of decode loss.
            The `loss_name` is property of corresponding loss function which
            could be shown in training log. If you want this loss
            item to be included into the backward graph, `loss_` must be the
            prefix of the name. Defaults to 'loss_ce'.
             e.g. dict(type='CrossEntropyLoss'),
             [dict(type='CrossEntropyLoss', loss_name='loss_ce'),
              dict(type='DiceLoss', loss_name='loss_dice')]
            Default: dict(type='CrossEntropyLoss').
        ignore_index (int | None): The label index to be ignored. When using
            masked BCE loss, ignore_index should be set to None. Default: 255.
        sampler (dict|None): The config of segmentation map sampler.
            Default: None.
        align_corners (bool): align_corners argument of F.interpolate.
            Default: False.
        init_cfg (dict or list[dict], optional): Initialization config dict.
